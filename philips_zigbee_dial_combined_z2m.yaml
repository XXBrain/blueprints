  name: Philips Tap Dial Switch 4 Lights or Custom (Z2M)
  description: Control lights, scenes and custom actions with a Philips Hue Tap Switch.
    Use the four buttons to control light(s) with an on/off or toggle command, activate
    scnenes and/or run custom actions. This blueprint supports short release, hold
    release and double press mqtt actions. Each beheaviour can configured seperatly.
    The dial can be used to dim the most recently used lights or call a custom rotation
    action. for that button. based on apollo1220 - https://github.com/apollo1220/blueprints/blob/main/philips_zigbee_dial.yaml
